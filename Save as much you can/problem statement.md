# Title- Save as much youÂ can

Shlok loves to travel. As his examination is over, he is planning for a vacation to Ujjain. The entire journey can be completed either by train or by bus. 

- Train ticket cost $X$<sub>$i$</sub> Rupees ($0$ <= $i$ < $N$).
- Bus ticket cost $Y$<sub>$i$</sub> Rupees ($0$ <= $i$ < $N$).

There are $N$ Stops. You are given the cost for train and bus for $N$ stops. Shlok can use train for $a$ stops and then can use bus for $b$ stops. As Shlok is weak in Maths, your task is to find the minimum cost required to complete the journey.

$Note$: You can use both the train and bus.

***Input***

The first line of input contains an integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of multiple lines of input:

- The first line of each test case contains an integer $N$
the number of stops.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers, $X$<sub>$i$</sub>
, denoting the cost of each Train stop.
- The third line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers, $Y$<sub>$i$</sub>
, denoting the cost of each Bus stop.
